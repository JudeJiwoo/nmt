## Introduction

The **Nested Music Transformer** is a model designed to enhance sequence generation tasks for music composition. It introduces a novel nested attention mechanism that enables better hierarchical structure modeling within musical sequences. This approach is particularly useful for capturing both local and global patterns in music.

To install the necessary dependencies, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/judejiwoo/nested-music-transformer.git
    cd nested-music-transformer
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
